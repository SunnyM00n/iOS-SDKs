/// Provides a unified interface you can use to apply video effects to frames.
///
/// The VTFrameProcessor gives access to a set of powerful video processing implementation suitable for different use cases.
/// A configuration object (conforming to the ``VTFrameProcessorConfiguration`` protocol) passes initialization and
/// configuration parameters for the processor. A Parameter object (conforming to the ``VTFrameProcessorParameters``
/// protocol) provides the parameters for each individual processing operation. A Configuration object and a Parameter
/// object define each processor implementation. These Configuration and Parameters objects for each implementation are
/// defined in a processor-specific header file.
///
/// Use an instance of this class to apply configured video effects either directly to pixel buffers or as a
/// part of Metal pipeline. The video effect must be specified as a ``VTFrameProcessorConfiguration`` instance at session
/// startup. Once a session is started, you need to call one of the process methods for each input frame. After all input
/// frames have been provided, session must be ended for the system to finish all pending processing.
///
/// After you call the process function, you must not modify input and output buffers (including attachments) before the
/// function returns or the system receives the callback, in the case of asynchronous processing.

/// Starts a new session and configures the processor pipeline for an effect.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - configuration: The system uses this parameter to create an effect pipeline for processing frames. This object
///       must conform to the ``VTFrameProcessorConfiguration`` interface.
///   - error: Contains error information if any. You may specify NULL for this parameter if you do not want the error information.

///
/// Use the respective ``VTFrameProcessorParameters`` to pass frame level settings and frame level input/output parameters
/// for the effect that you configured this session for by calling ``startSessionWithConfiguration:error``.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - parameters: A `VTFrameProcessorParameters` based object to specify additional frame based parameters to use
///     during processing. It needs to match the configuration type used during start session.
///   - error: Contains error information if any. You may specify NULL for this parameter if you do not want the error information.

///
/// - Parameters:
///   - parameters: A `VTFrameProcessorParameters` based object to specify additional frame based parameters to use
///     during processing. It needs to match the configuration type used during start session.
///   - completionHandler: This completion handler is called when frame processing is completed. The completion handler
///     receives the same parameters object that you provided to the original call, as well as an `NSError` which contains
///     an error code if processing was not successful.

///
/// Use with frame processor configurations which allow multiple output frames from a single processing call, such
/// as frame rate conversion processor cases when you need access to output frames as they become available, rather than
/// waiting for all output frames to be complete.
///
/// This interface is suitable for low-latency scenarios when a call would generate multiple output frames, but waiting
/// for all frames to be generated before beginning to use the frames is not ideal. Because the processor may use the
/// output frames as references for frames still being generated, the output frames are strictly read-only. If you want
/// to modify the frames, you must create a copy first.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - parameters: A `VTFrameProcessorParameters` based object to specify additional frame based parameters to use
///       during processing. It needs to match the configuration type used during start session.
///   - frameOutputHandler: This frame output handler is called once for each destination frame in the provided parameters
///       if no errors are encountered. The output handler receives the same parameters object that you provided to the
///       original call, a flag indicating if this is the final output to be called for this processing request, and the
///       presentation timestamp associated with the `VTFrameProcessorFrame` that it is being called for. The `NSError`
///       parameter contains an error code if processing was not successful.

/// > Note: this function waits until all previously inserted tasks in the command buffer finish before running. Tasks
/// inserted after the `processWithCommandBuffer` returns are run by the system after the effect is applied. Processing
